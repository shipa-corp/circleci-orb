  Deploy an application to a Shipa cluster. You must set the following environment
  variables in your Circle CI project settings. SHIPA_PASSWORD with your Shipa password
  and optionally SHIPA_CA with the x509 cert for your Shipa connection. Note in the example
  we are deploying a Go program. In this case the Go platform must be added to your shipa
  installation i.e. shipa platform add go
